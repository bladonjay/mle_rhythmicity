mle_rhythhmicity
================

An improved method for examining neural single unit rhythmicity using maxmimun 
likelihood estimation for a parametric distribution of lags.

Daniel Manson (d.manson.11@ucl.ac.uk) has adapted this code for PYTHON, it is
available at https://gist.github.com/d1manson/f1d8907865298808941d . Note that
it requires another file, available at:
